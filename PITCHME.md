- @fa[paw]() We did not know how to use things like React and Flask but we learned quickly

+++

- @fa[paw]() We were not afraid to communicate about stories that we were falling behind on

+++

- @fa[paw]() We shared code equally and made changes to each otherâ€™s work to improve quality

+++

- @fa[paw]() We were willing to dig through documentation and understand how all the libraries we were using worked

    - Filter button checkboxes

+++

- @fa[paw]() How to deal with merge conflicts and conflicts in general

---
### What can we do better?
+++

- @fa[paw]() Organize our data better so that we don't need ternary operators in ternary operators in ternar...

+++

---

### What can they do better?

+++

- @fa[paw]() Since they have a lot of data to display, they should test on various devices to see how well that data is being shown

+++

- @fa[paw]() Their testing could be more robust and cover more of their code

---

+++

- @fa[paw]() How will they link up models to specific instances of other models?

+++

- @fa[paw]() How will they handle the serving size for food items?

+++

- @fa[paw]() Why do their API endpoints perform a data dump instead of fulfilling a specific task such as searching?
