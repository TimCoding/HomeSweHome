### Self Critique

# STRONG

---

### What did we do well?

+++
- We did not know how to use things like React and Flask but we learned quickly

+++

- We were not afraid to communicate about stories that we were falling behind on

+++

- We shared code equally and made changes to each otherâ€™s work to improve quality

+++

- We were willing to dig through documentation and understand how all the libraries we were using worked
---
### What did we learn?

+++

- Build custom react components
    - Filter button checkboxes
+++

- Set up a postgres database
+++

- How to deal with merge conflicts and conflicts in general

---
### What can we do better?
+++

- Organize our data better so that we don't need ternary operators in ternary operators in ternar...

+++

- Write tests first instead of the end, especially if you don't know how the testing libraries work

---
### What puzzles us?
+++

- We occasionally get a random 500 error in our development environments

---
### Other Critique

Need to refine this section

### What did they do well?

+++

- Good for health conscious users

+++

- Nice splash page

+++

- They have breadcrumb feature which is unique and innovative, strong 

+++

- They have great error handling and clearly thought about their users 
---

### What did we learn from their website?
+++

- Error handling

+++

- For pages with a small amount of data it might be better to do searching/filtering tasks on the front end 

+++

- We will learn what a met is..hopefully (putting what it actually meant here)

---

### What can they do better?

+++

- Their symlink may be broken

+++

- Since they have a lot of data to display, they should test on various devices to see how well that data is being shown

+++

- Their testing could be more robust and cover more of their code

---

### What puzzles us about their website?

+++

- How will they link up models to specific instances of other models?

+++

- How will they handle the serving size for food items?

+++

- Why do their API endpoints perform a data dump instead of fulfilling a specific task such as searching?
